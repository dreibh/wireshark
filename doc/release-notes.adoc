= Wireshark {wireshark-version} Release Notes
// Asciidoctor Syntax Quick Reference:
// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

This is an experimental release intended to test new features for Wireshark 4.4.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What’s New

// Add a summary of **major** changes here.
// Add other changes to "New and Updated Features" below.

Improved display filter support for value strings (optional string
representations for numeric fields).

Display filter functions can be implemented as runtime-loadable C plugins.

Plugin registration API was refactored. Plugin authors must update their
plugins as described below.

Many other improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.

//=== Bug Fixes

//The following bugs have been fixed:
//* wsbuglink:5000[]
//* wsbuglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cveidlink:2014-2486[]
//* Wireshark grabs your ID at 3 am, goes to Waffle House, and insults people.

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 4.2.0:

//* The Windows installers now ship with Qt 6.5.2.
//  They previously shipped with Qt 6.2.3.

* Display filter syntax-related enhancements:

  ** Better handling of comparisons with value strings. Now the display filter engine can
     correctly handle cases where multiple different numeric values map to the same value
     string, including but not limited to range-type value strings.

  ** Fields with value strings now support regular expression matching.

  ** Date and time values now support arithmetic, with some restrictions:
     the multiplier/divisor must be an integer or float and appear on the right-hand
     side of the operator.

  ** The keyword "bitand" can be used as an alternative syntax for the bitwise-and operator.

  ** Functions alone can now be used as an entire logical expression.
     The result of the expression is the truthiness of the function return
     value (or of all values if more than one). This is useful for example to write
     "len(something)" instead of "len(something) != 0". Even more so if a function
     returns itself a boolean value, it is now possible to write
     "bool_test(some.field)" instead of having to write "bool_test(some.field) == True"
     (both forms are now valid).

  ** Display filter references can be written without curly braces. It
     is now possible to write `$frame.number` instead of `${frame.number}` for example.

  ** Added new display filter functions to test various IP address properties.
     Check the wireshark-filter(5) manpage for more information.

  ** Display filter macros can be written using a function-like notation.
     The macro `${mymacro:arg1; ...; argN}` can be written
     $mymacro(arg1, ..., argN)`.

* Display filter functions can be implemented as libwireshark plugins. Plugins are loaded
  during startup from the usual binary plugin configuration directories. See the
  `ipaddr.c` source file in the distribution for an example of a display filter C plugin
  and the doc/plugins.example folder for generic instructions how to build a plugin.

* Display filter autocompletions now also include display filter functions.

* The display filter macro configuration file has changed format. It now uses
  the same format as the "dfilters" file and has been renamed accordingly to
  "dmacros". Internally it no longer uses the UAT API and the display filter macro
  GUI dialog has been updated. There is some basic migration logic implemented
  but it is advisable to check that the "dfilter_macros" (old) and
  "dmacros" (new) files in the profile directory are consistent.

* When selecting "Manage Interfaces" from "Capture Options", Wireshark only
  attempts to reconnect to rpcap (remote) hosts that were connected to in the
  last session, instead of every remote host that the current profile has ever
  connected to. wsbuglink:17484[]

* Adding interfaces at startup is about twice as fast, and has many fewer
  UAC pop-ups when npcap is installed with access restricted to Administrators
  on Windows

* The Resolved Addresses dialog only shows what addresses and ports are
  present in the file (not including information from static files), and
  selected rows or the entire table can be saved or copied to the clipboard
  in several formats.

=== Major API Changes

* Plugin registration API was refactored. Plugin authors must do the following:
  1 - Remove the existing bloilerplate (version, want_major` and `want_minor` and
  plugin API declarations. 2 - Add a struct ws_module to the plugin.
  3 - Call one of the WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_REGISTER_* macros. See README.plugins
  sections 5 and doc/plugins.example/hello.c for details and examples.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system specific to that platform.
A list of third-party packages can be found on the
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform.
You can use menu:Help[About Wireshark,Folders] or `tshark -G folders` to find the default locations on your system.
