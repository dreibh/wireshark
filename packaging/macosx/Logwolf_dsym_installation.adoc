== Debugging Symbols for Logwolf

This archive contains the debugging symbols for Logwolf {logwolf-version}.
The debugging symbols are only necessary if Logwolf is crashing and you need to report an issue to the Logwolf development team.

WARNING: This won't work properly with any version other than Logwolf {logwolf-version}.

To install the symbols, drag _Logwolf.dSYM_ to the same location as _Logwolf_.
This is usually your _Applications_ folder.

To uninstall, drag _Logwolf.dSYM_ to the trash.
