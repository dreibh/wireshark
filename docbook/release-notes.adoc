= Wireshark {wireshark-version} Release Notes
// Asciidoctor Syntax Quick Reference:
// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

This is an experimental release intended to test new features for Wireshark 4.2.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What’s New

// Add a summary of **major** changes here.
// Add other changes to "New and Updated Features" below.

A Windows installer for Arm64 has been added.

Windows installer file names now have the format Wireshark-<version>-<architecture>.exe.

Wireshark is now better about generating valid UTF-8 output.

A new display filter feature for filtering raw bytes has been added.

Display filter autocomplete is smarter about not suggesting invalid syntax.

menu:Tools[MAC Address Blocks] can lookup a MAC address in the IEEE OUI registry.

Some external configuration files have been compiled in for improved start-up times.

The installation target no longer installs development headers by default.

The Wireshark installation is relocatable on Linux (and other ELF platforms
with support for relative RPATHs).

Wireshark can be compiled on Windows using https://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2].
Check the Developer's guide for instructions.

Wireshark can be cross-compiled for Windows using Linux.
Check the Developer's guide for instructions.

Packet list sorting has been updated.

menu:Tools[Browser (SSL Keylog)] can launch your web browser with the
SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable set to the appropriate value.

Many other improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.

=== Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

* wsbuglink:18413[No Audio in RTP player with Wireshark 4.0.0] - RTP player do not play audio frequently on Windows builds with Qt6.

* wsbuglink:18510[Paused playback cannot continue to play] - Playback marker does not move after resume with Qt6.


//* wsbuglink:5000[]
//* wsbuglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cveidlink:2014-2486[]
//* Wireshark grabs your ID at 3 am, goes to Waffle House, and insults people.

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 4.0.0:

* The Windows installers now ship with Qt 6.5.2.
  They previously shipped with Qt 6.2.3.

// * The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.75.
//   They previously shipped with Npcap 1.71.

* The API has been updated to ensure that the dissection engine produces valid UTF-8 strings.

* Wireshark now builds with Qt6 by default. To use Qt5 instead pass USE_qt6=OFF to CMake.

* The "ciscodump" extcap supports Cisco IOS XE 17.x.

* The default interval between GUI updates when capturing has been decreased
  from 500ms to 100ms, and is now configurable.

* The *-n* option also now disables IP address geolocation information lookup
  in configured MaxMind databases (and geolocation lookup can be enabled with
  *-Ng*.) This is most relevant for tshark, where geolocation lookups are
  synchronous.

* The display filter drop-down list is now sorted by "most recently used" instead
  of "most recently created".

* Display filter syntax-related changes:

  ** It is now possible to filter on raw packet data for any field by using the syntax ``@some.field == <bytes...>``.
     This can be useful to filter on malformed UTF-8 strings, among other use cases where it is necessary to
     look at the field's raw data.

  ** Negation (unary minus) now works with any display filter arithmetic expression.

  ** Using the slice operator with strings produces a string. Previously it
     would produce a byte array. This is useful to index/slice UTF-8 multibyte strings.
     String byte slices can still be obtained using the "@" (raw operator) prefix.

  ** Arithmetic expressions are allowed as set elements.

  ** Absolute date and time values can be written as Unix time.

  ** The limitation where a minus sign needed to be preceded by a space character
     has been removed.

  ** Added XOR logical operator.

  ** Fixed the implementation of `all ... in` membership operator
     (https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/19188[#19188]).

  ** The deprecated ~≃ operator symbol has been removed. It was replaced by !== in version 4.0.

* Running the test suite requires the https://pypi.org/project/pytest/[pytest]
  Python module. The emulation layer that allowed running tests without pytest
  installed has been removed.

* When saving files or exporting packets after changing their time with the
  "Time Shift" dialog, the shifted time is written to the new file.

* TLS secrets used in decrypting packets can be embedded (or discarded) from
  the capture file via the GUI, similar to the options --inject-secrets and
  --discard-all-secrets in editcap.

* The text of any configured column (displayed or hidden) can be filtered
  anywhere that filters are used - in display filters, filters in taps, coloring
  rules, Wireshark read filters, and the -Y, -R, and -e options to tshark,
  the "Apply as Filter" GUI option, etc.

  ** The filter field names are prefixed by "\_ws.col", followed by a lowercase
     version of the COL_ name found in epan/column-utils.h, e.g. "_ws.col.info"
     or "_ws.col.protocol"

  ** Using the column names as a filter is slower than other filter types
     because the columns must be constructed, so when the same filtering
     can be achieved via other fields, prefer that.

* The external name resolution text files "manuf", "enterprises" and "services"
  have been removed and replaced with static binary data. You can dump the
  respective internal data using `tshark -G manuf|enterprises|services`.

* The Lua console dialogs under the menu:Tools[] menu were refactored and redesigned.
  It now consists of a single dialog window for input and output.

* Wireshark now shows byte units in the statistics in the user-selected language
  (uses the system default language by default).

* Packet list sorting has been improved:

  ** When sorting packet list with a filter applied, only the visible packets are
     sorted, which greatly increases sorting speed.

  ** The cache size for column text is limited to a default of 10000 rows,
     which limits the maximum memory usage. The maximum value can be changed in
     Preferences->Appearance->Layout

  ** Due to the above, columns that require packet dissection can only be sorted
     if the number of visible rows is less than the cache size. If there are
     more rows visible, a warning will appear. Columns that do not require packet
     dissection (those that calculated directly from the capture file frame
     headers, such as packet number, time, and frame length) can be sorted with
     any number of visible rows.

  ** Sorting can be interrupted.

* When changing the dissector via the "Decode As" table for values that
  have default dissectors registered, selecting "(none)" will select
  no dissection (while still allowing heuristic dissectors to attempt to
  dissect.) The previous behavior was to reset the dissector to the default.
  To facilitate resetting the dissector, the default dissector is now sorted
  at the top of the list of possible dissector options.

* The personal extcap plugin folder location on Unix has been changed to
  follow existing conventions for architecture-dependent files.
  The extcap personal folder is now ``$HOME/.local/lib/wireshark/extcap``.
  Previously it was ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark/extcap``.

* The "init.lua" file is now loaded from any of the Lua plugin directories.
  Previously it was loaded from the personal configuration directory. (For
  backward-compatibility this is still allowed; note that deprecated features
  may be removed in a future release).

* Installation of development headers must be done explicitly using the CMake
  command `cmake --install <builddir> --component Development`.

* The Windows build has a new SpeexDSP external dependency (https://www.speex.org).
  The speex code that was previously bundled has been removed.

* New `--print-timers` option added to tshark.

=== Removed Features and Support

* With the addition of the universal and consistent filtering support for
  column text, the previous support in the -e option to tshark for displaying
  column text via the column title has been removed in general. Those field names
  cannot be used elsewhere (as they may not be legal filter names) and create
  confusion if more than one column has the same title or if a column is renamed.
  Prefer the column format instead, e.g. "_ws.col.info" for "_ws.col.Info".
  However, for backwards compatibility with existing tools and scripts, the
  titles of the default columns can continue to be used with "tshark -e"
  (but not elsewhere.)

* The bundled script "dtd_gen.lua" that was disabled by default has been removed
  from the installation. link:https://wiki.wireshark.org/Contrib[It can be found in the Wireshark Wiki under "Contrib"].

* The Wi-Fi NAN dissector filter name has been changed from 'nan' to 'wifi_nan'.

=== Updated Protocol Support

* JSON: The dissector now has a preference to enable/disable "unescaping"
  of string values. By default it is off. Previously it was always on.

* JSON: The dissector now supports "Display JSON in raw form".

* IPv6: The dissector has a new preference to show some semantic details
  about addresses (default off).

* IPv6: The dissector now supports dissecting
  https://www.ipv6plus.net/Phase3/apn6/[
  Application-aware IPv6 Networking (APN6) option]
  in the Hop-by-Hop Options Header (HBH) and Destination Options Header (DOH).
  This feature supports to dissect all three types of APN ID,
  which are 32-bit, 64-bit and 128-bit in length.

* XML: The dissector now supports display character according to the "encoding"
  attribute of the XML declaration, and has a new preference to set default
  character encoding for some XML document without "encoding" attribute.

* SIP: The dissector now has a new preference to set default charset for
  displaying the body of SIP messages in raw text view.

* HTTP: The dissector now supports dissecting chunked data in streaming reassembly
  mode. Subdissectors of HTTP can register itself in "streaming_content_type"
  subdissector table for enabling streaming reassembly mode while transferring in
  chunked encoding. This feature ensures the server stream messages of GRPC-Web
  over HTTP/1.1 can be dissected even if the last chunk is absent.

* The media type dissector table now properly treats media types and subtypes
  as case-insensitive automatically, per RFC 6838. Media types no longer need
  to be lower cased before registering or looking up in the table.

* CFM: The dissector has been overhauled and updated to the level of IEEE std
  802.1Q-2022 and ITU-T Rec. G.8013/Y.1371 (08/2015). This includes dissection
  of additional PDU types and TLVs as well as deeper dissection of existing PDUs
  and TLVs.

Too many other protocol updates have been made to list them all here.

=== Major API Changes

* Lua function "package.prepend_path" has been removed. If you need it please
  consider adding your own package.path customization code or installing your
  dependencies in Wireshark's default paths.

* The reassemble_streaming_data_and_call_subdissector() API has been added to provide a simpler way to
  reassemble the streaming data of a high level protocol that is not on top of TCP.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system specific to that platform.
A list of third-party packages can be found on the
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform.
You can use menu:Help[About Wireshark,Folders] or `tshark -G folders` to find the default locations on your system.
