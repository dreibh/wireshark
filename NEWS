Wireshark 3.7.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 3.6.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

    • The PCRE2 library (https://www.pcre.org/) is now a required
      dependency to build Wireshark.

    • A compiler with C11 support is required.

  Many improvements have been made. See the “New and Updated Features”
  section below for more details.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.6.0:

     • The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.60. They previously
       shipped with Npcap 1.55.

     • Display filter syntax:

        • Set elements must be separated using a comma, e.g: {1, 2,
       "foo"}. Using only whitespace as separator was deprecated in 3.6
       and is now a syntax error.

        • Adds support for some additional character escape sequences in
       double quoted strings. Besides octal and hex byte specification
       the following C escape sequences are now supported with the same
       meaning: \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v. Previously they were only
       supported with character constants.

        • Unrecognized escape sequences are now treated as a syntax
       error. Previously they were treated as a literal character. In
       addition to the sequences indicated above, backslash, single
       quotation and double quotation mark are also valid sequences: \\,
       \', \".

        • The display filter engine now uses PCRE2 instead of GRegex
       (GLib bindings to the older end-of-life PCRE library). PCRE2 is
       compatible with PCRE so the user-visible changes should be
       minimal. Some exotic patterns may now be invalid and require
       rewriting.

        • Adds a new strict equality operator "===" or "all_eq". The
       expression "a === b" is true if and only if all a’s are equal to
       b. The negation of "===" can now be written as "!==" (any_ne), in
       adittion to "~=" (introduced in Wireshark 3.6.0).

        • Adds the aliases "any_eq" for "==" and "all_ne" for "!=".

     • HTTP2 dissector now supports using fake headers to parse the
       DATAs of streams captured without first HEADERS frames of a
       long-lived stream (like gRPC streaming call which allows sending
       many request or response messages in one HTTP2 stream). User can
       specify fake headers according to the server port, stream id and
       direction of the long-lived stream that we start capturing
       packets after it is established.

     • Mesh Connex (MCX) support in existing 802.11 packets.

     • Capture Options dialog contains same configuration icon as
       Welcome Screen. It is possible to configure interface there.

  New File Format Decoding Support

  New Protocol Support

   FiveCo’s Legacy Register Access Protocol (5co-legacy), Host IP
   Configuration Protocol (HICP), Mesh Connex (MCX), and Secure Host IP
   Configuration Protocol (SHICP)

  Updated Protocol Support

   Too many protocols have been updated to list here.

  New and Updated Capture File Support

  Major API Changes

     • proto.h: The field display types "STR_ASCII" and "STR_UNICODE"
       were removed. Use "BASE_NONE" instead.

 Getting Wireshark

  Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
  https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[1] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use "Help › About
  Wireshark › Folders" or `tshark -G folders` to find the default
  locations on your system.

 Getting Help

  The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
  found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/

  Community support is available on Wireshark’s Q&A site[2] and on the
  wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription information and archives
  for all of Wireshark’s mailing lists can be found on the web site[3].

  Bugs and feature requests can be reported on the issue tracker[4].

 Frequently Asked Questions

  A complete FAQ is available on the Wireshark web site[5].
