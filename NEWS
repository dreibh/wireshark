Wireshark 4.3.0 Release Notes

 This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
 Wireshark 4.4.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  Improved display filter support for value strings (optional string
  representations for numeric fields).

  Display filter functions can be implemented as runtime-loadable C
  plugins.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 4.2.0:

     • Display filter syntax-related enhancements:

        • Better handling of comparisons with value strings. Now the
       display filter engine can correctly handle cases where multiple
       different numeric values map to the same value string, including
       but not limited to range-type value strings.

        • Fields with value strings now support regular expression
       matching.

        • Date and time values now support arithmetic, with some
       restrictions: the multiplier/divisor must be an integer or float
       and appear on the right-hand side of the operator.

        • The keyword "bitand" can be used as an alternative syntax for
       the bitwise-and operator.

        • Functions alone can now be used as an entire logical
       expression. The result of the expression is the truthiness of the
       function return value (or of all values if more than one). This
       is useful for example to write "len(something)" instead of
       "len(something) != 0". Even more so if a function returns itself
       a boolean value, it is now possible to write
       "bool_test(some.field)" instead of having to write
       "bool_test(some.field) == True" (both forms are now valid).

     • Display filter autocompletions now also include display filter
       functions.

  New Protocol Support

   MAC NR Framed (mac-nr-framed), RF4CE Network Layer (RF4CE), and RF4CE
   Profile (RF4CE Profile)

  Updated Protocol Support

     • IPv6: The "show address detail" preference is now enabled by
       default. The address details provided have been extended to
       include more special purpose address block properties
       (forwardable, globally-routable, etc).

   Too many other protocol updates have been made to list them all here.

  Major API Changes

     • Plugins should provide a `plugin_describe()` function that
       returns an ORed list of flags consisting of the plugin types used
       (declared in wsutil/plugins.h).

 Getting Wireshark

  Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
  https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[1] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use "Help › About
  Wireshark › Folders" or `tshark -G folders` to find the default
  locations on your system.

 Getting Help

  The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
  found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/

  Community support is available on Wireshark’s Q&A site[2] and on the
  wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription information and archives
  for all of Wireshark’s mailing lists can be found on the web site[3].

  Bugs and feature requests can be reported on the issue tracker[4].

  You can learn protocol analysis and meet Wireshark’s developers at
  SharkFest[5].

 How You Can Help

  The Wireshark Foundation helps as many people as possible understand
  their networks as much as possible. You can find out more and donate
